# Introduction to Python - A Step at a Time

#### Find this page at https://github.com/data-space/python-intro

This Python tutorial has several steps:

1. __Download__: Anaconda (Python ecosystem), tutorial files
1. __Datacamp__: Intro to Python for Data Science
1. __Install__: Anaconda 
1. __Jupyter__: web based notebook interface to Python
1. __Python essentials__: libraries `pandas` and `numpy`

Step 1: __Download__

1. Download Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
    - Select the icon or the tab that corresponds to your operating system 
    - Select the "GRAPHICAL INSTALLER (424MB)" for Python 3.6 version
1. Create a directory called `python-intro` for today's material (that you can easily find)
1. Download all of the files listed at the top of this page into the `python-intro` directory
    
Step 2: __Datacamp__

1. Browse to https://datacamp.com
    - Select "Courses" along the top 
    - Select "Intro to Python for Data Science"
    - Select "Hello Python!" (video introduction to Python)
1. Select "The Python Interface". Try the forward and back arrows and the Course Outline link at the top center. Notice the 4 sections of this page:
    - __Background__: what you will learn from this page
    - __Instructions__: your task for this page, hints and the answer
    - __Console__: you can run any Python code here (and see the result)
    - __Editor__: type your answers here. Click "Submit Answer" to check your answer
1. Select "Other variable types"
    - There are four types of values: `int`, `float`, `str` and `bool`
    - The `type` function returns the type of a value or variable
1. Select "Create a list"
    - ```a = "is nice"```
    - ```b = "is also nice"```
    - ```my_list = ["Bentley", a, "Bryant", b]```

Step 3: __Install Anaconda__ 

1. Run the installer
    - On Mac, choose "Install on a specific disk..." and then choose "Macintosh HD"
    
Step 4: __Jupyter__

1. Run the Anaconda application on your computer
1. Run Jupyter from the Anaconda application
1. From Jupyter browse to the tutorial directory
1. Select `Python 3` from the `New` menu in the upper right of the Jupyter browser window
1. Demo: command and edit modes; markdown and code cells; running code cells; formatting markdown cells; cut, copy and paste for cells

Step 5: __Python essentials__

1. Open `pandas.ipynb` with the Jupyter browser
