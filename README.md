Step 1: __Download__

1. Create a directory called `python-intro` for today's material (that you can easily find)
1. Download all of the files from https://github.com/data-space/python-intro 
1. Copy all of these files (from your `Downloads` directory) into `python-intro`
1. Download Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
    - Select the icon or the tab that corresponds to your operating system 
    - Select the "GRAPHICAL INSTALLER (424MB)" for Python 3.6 version
    
Step 2: __Datacamp__

1. Browse to https://datacamp.com
    - Select "Courses" along the top 
    - Select "Intro to Python for Data Science"
    - Select "Hello Python!" (video introduction to Python)
1. Select "The Python Interface". Notice four sections of the page:
    - Background: what you will learn from this page
    - Instructions: your task for this page, hints and the answer
    - Console: you can run any Python code here (and see the result)
    - Editor: type your answers here. Click "Submit Answer" to check your answer
    - Try the forward and back arrows and the Course Outline link at the top center 
1. Select "Other variable types"
    - There are four types of values: `int`, `float`, `str` and `bool`
    - The `type` function returns the type of a value or variable
1. Select "Create a list"
    - ```a = "is nice"```
    - ```b = "is also nice"```
    - ```my_list = ["Bentley", a, "Bryant", b]```

Step 3: __Install Anaconda__ 

1. Run the installer
    - On Mac, choose "Install on a specific disk..." and then choose "Macintosh HD"
    
Step 4: __Jupyter__

1. Run the Anaconda application on your computer
1. Run Jupyter from the Anaconda application
1. From Jupyter browse to the tutorial directory
1. Select `Python 3` from the `New` menu in the upper right of the Jupyter browser window
1. Demo: command and edit modes; markdown and code cells; running code cells; formatting markdown cells; cut, copy and paste for cells
